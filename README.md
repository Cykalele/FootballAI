# FootballAI â€“ Combined Repository

This repository serves as the **entry point** to the complete FootballAI system.  
It does **not** contain the code of the system itself, but links to the two main repositories:

- **Backend** â€“ [FootballAI_Backend](https://github.com/Cykalele/FootballAI_Backend)  
  Contains the AI-based processing pipeline, tracking, metric computation, and backend server logic.  
  Detailed installation and usage instructions are provided in the backend repository.

- **Frontend** â€“ [FootballAI_UI](https://github.com/Cykalele/FootballAI_UI)  
  Provides the user interface for uploading videos, assigning teams, visualizing metrics, and downloading results.  
  Detailed installation and usage instructions are provided in the frontend repository.
