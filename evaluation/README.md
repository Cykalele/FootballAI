# Evaluation Results â€“ FootballAI

This directory contains the evaluation outputs for all system components described in the thesis.  
Each subfolder corresponds to a specific component:

- `object-detection/` â€“ YOLOv12s model evaluation with ground-truth test data (precision, recall, mAP, curves).
- `tracking/` â€“ Player and ball tracking performance based on persisted match data.
- `view-transformation/` â€“ Pitch projection and accuracy analysis.
- `team-assignment/` â€“ Automatic and manual team assignment evaluation.
- `metrics/` â€“ Aggregated performance indicators and visualizations.

The results (except for object detection) are based on a six-minute amateur football match recording.
